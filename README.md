# Podcast Feed Generator
A GitHub action to generate a podcast feed from a YAML file. YAML is much easier to read and write than XML, and this action will convert your YAML file into a valid podcast feed.

# Usage
Turn on Github Pages
In your repository, go to Setting > Pages and select the main branch as the source. This will create a link to your page and give all of the content in the main branch a URL. Note the URL for the next step.
